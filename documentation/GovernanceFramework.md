  # TenderBullet Governance Framework Documentation 

  ## Overview
  The TenderBullet Platform Governance Framework is the legal foundation for the blockchain-based TenderBullet network - an procurement-based registry for government agencies and business sectors.   

Members that constitute the TenderBullet platform are all-related stakeholders of the TenderBullet. The project is open source and allows any organizations of this nature to join.   

The TenderBullet Platform Governance framework supports the system by executing the various agreements relating to the management of or transacting in the system.  

## Motivation  
The governance framework is needed to allow deliberation on the overhead required to operate an open network of TenderBullet devices across the whole world. Some of the deliberations could be on:  

* Agreement on the accuracy and latest information about the controllers and their related devices on the blockchain network  
* Updates to the codes. Deliberation on features or initiatives for the next system iteration.  
* Changes to the governing rules for the governance of the platform.   
* Ideas to ensure the financial sustainability of the platform. 

## Corporate structureÂ 
The Governing Board is responsible for overseeing the TenderBullet Governance Framework. Members that constitute the governing board are representatives from each participating party on the TenderBullet platform. Recommendations of potential representatives that would be voted into the governing body would be provided by the participating organizations.  

It is envisioned that the governing body may be registered as a non-profit entity to allow it to carry out its activities legally.  

## Roles  
1.  **Governing Board:** This is the body responsible for making decisions related to the network and its participants.  

2.  **(Blockchain Network) Operators:** These are roles that are contributing to the infrastructure, maintenance, and financial needs of the platform conforming to the TenderBullet Governance Framework.  

3.  **TenderBullet Owners:** These are founders of TenderBullets, investors who bid in TenderBullet or bid evaluation committees in TenderBullet, and chief vigilance officers in TenderBullet.  

4.  **Developers:** These are technical staff members responsible for writing source code for the blockchain network. 

## Policies

    * Transactions are started and processed by the peer nodes of the participating party.
